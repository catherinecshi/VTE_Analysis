VTE AND CORRELATION WITH UNCERTAINTY

This is the code for Cat's senior honors thesis in the Jadhav Lab in Brandeis University - The influence on learning from uncertainty in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex

Some Aims of the project in order of likelihood of completion
    1. Characterization of Vicarious Trial and Errors (VTEs) (>99%)
        - At choice points, rats will sometimes engage in a behavior where they look from one choice to another choice. This is known as VTEs.
            - VTEs have been shown to correlate with learning (Tolman, 1948) and hypothesized to represent deliberation (Redish, 2016)
            - There is also some evidence to suggest that VTEs co-occur with theta sweeps alternations, where neural representations of the animal's current location sweeps down alternatingly down two choice arms.
        - VTEs have rarely been studied in mazes with more than two arms, despite the possibility of VTEs of multiple arms being an interesting natural progression of investigation
            - as we use a radial arm maze, we can investigate the nature of VTEs when rats are faced with more than two choice arms to VTE down
        - Furthermore, as we are using a transitive inference task structure, we are able to investigate VTEs in the face of a changing environment
            - in the task, there are 4 pair associations to be learned during the training period
            - when one pair association has been learned to a point of criteria being met, another pair is added, until all 4 has been learned
            - when a new pair association is being added, a new arm corresponding to the new element being introduced is made available to the rats
    2. Model Expected & Unexpected Uncertainty, and see whether VTEs correlate with either
    3. Look at theta sweeping activity 
    4. See if SWRs correlate with expected or unexpected uncertainty

Use by running scripts, which should all have docstrings describing what they do and which figures they produce
