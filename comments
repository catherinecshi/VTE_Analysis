BP07 Day6 is incomplete and doesn't follow the format my current code for getting ss logs
    it doesn't have a csv file but has a ss logs
Same for BP07 Day10, except the ss log follows the format for my code
    but no csv file
TH508 Day 15 - more than one DLC file


benefits of tracking the body instead of head for initial analysis of where the rat is in space

filtered out based on likelihood first, because i assume the jumps shouldn't include coords with low likelihood

do framerates for occupancy again

i need to find a better way to do the gridding when generating lines
