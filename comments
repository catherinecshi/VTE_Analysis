BP07 Day6 is incomplete and doesn't follow the format my current code for getting ss logs
    it doesn't have a csv file but has a ss logs
Same for BP07 Day10, except the ss log follows the format for my code
    but no csv file
TH508 Day 15 - more than one DLC file


benefits of tracking the body instead of head for initial analysis of where the rat is in space

filtered out based on likelihood first, because i assume the jumps shouldn't include coords with low likelihood

do framerates for occupancy again

i need to find a better way to do the gridding when generating lines

BP13 - day1, day 7, day 14, day 15, day 16, day 18, day 19, day 24, day 29
TH605 - day1, day 3, day 5, day 6, day 7, day 9, day 10, day 19, day 29
BP15 - day 1, day 4, day 8, day 9, day 11, day 13, day 14, day 21, day 27
BP16 - day 1, day 5, day 9, day 10, day 11, day 12, day 13, day 16, day 19
BP22 - day 1, day 4, day 7, day 8, day 9, day 10, day 11, day 21, day 50
BP21 - day 1, day 6, day 11, day 12, day 19, day 26, day 27, day, day 53
BP19

remember how many rats in my data set

need to sort out days 42-45 for bp11
need to sort out day 31 for TH405
bp19 day 1 wrong on spreadsheet

bp15 day 13
th508 day31
th508 day27
th405 day31

im using 11 rats in my data

main problems
- weird addition of tottal (sometimes correct) into all trials near the start? - not fixed
- sometimes statescript is weird and it'll have an extra middle numbers ( should be fixed)
- i don't think i'm dealing with it ending very well - look at TH605 day5, i get 19/25 BC but reality is 20/25 BC bc it ends on BC
- not having starting commens (should be fixed)
- some skipped days - print out days when they're skipped in the future
